# Create React Component

** STILL IN PROGRESS **

This is template for React components

This page was generated by Storybook and you can use this for developing your components.

## Features

- @mui/material
- Storybook
- Github Pages with Storybook
- Prettier/Eslint
- Husky for lint-staged
- Webpack
- Typescript with Babel
- Pnpm

## Projects

### `source` branch

Includes sample projects and everything. It's used for

- Sample component, template, and script changes (development)
- Puhlishing github template branch for this repo
- Publishing npm template package

### `template` branch

Cloned by npm script.

Will be directly cloned into a new component project and the package name will be replaced.

The cloned project can be published into npm

### `gh-pages` branch

Demo html page for the sample button component and shows readme for the npm template

This can be published into github for the component as well with `publish:pages`

## Scripts

- `storybook`: Runs story book locally for developing
- `build`: Builds with webpack
- `publish:pages`: Pushes storybook into gh-pages branch
- `lint`: Linting
- `format`: Auto-formats using prettier

More to come...

- `publish:npm`: will push/tab version into github and publish into npm

## How to use

You can create an empty project with a sample button component by:

```
npm init @kennyhyun/react-component
```

You can create and publish a simple single component or components library

You might also consider following use case

1. create a monorepo with pnpm
1. create an app using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)
1. and then create a component library with this

Using [pnpm workspace](https://pnpm.io/workspaces), you can use component library without publishing (to npm)

## ToDos

- [ ] publishing npm package
- [ ] Jest
- [ ] Storyshot for snapshot testing
