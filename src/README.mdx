- `build`: Builds with webpack
- `publish:pages`: Pushes storybook into gh-pages branch
- `lint`: Linting

## How to use

You can create an empty project with a sample button component by:

```
npm init @kennyhyun/react-component
```

You can create and publish a simple single component or components library

You might also consider following use case

1. create a monorepo with pnpm
1. create an app using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)
1. and then create a component library with this

Using [pnpm workspace](https://pnpm.io/workspaces), you can use component library without publishing (to npm)

- [ ] publishing npm package
- [ ] Jest
